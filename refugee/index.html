      <p>This project aims to demonstrate the size of the refugee population present in each country for each year from 1951 to 2016. 
         This issue is relevant to social organization and was driven by the curiosity of knowing where they went, since it is more common the media say of which countries they came from.
        There has been a significant change in the way this group has spread throughout the world since the 1990s. According to the UNHCR Global Trends report, there has been an increase in forced displacement since 1990, with rapid growth in the last five years in volume.
        The conflicts in Somalia, Afghanistan and Syria are examples of situations that contribute to the increase of this population of UN attention.

      <p style="font-weight: 700;">UNHCR's populations of concerns includes individuals:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>recognised under refugee status, even if temporarily</li>
          <li>asylum-seekers</li>
          <li>internally displaced persons (IDPs) who have been forced to leave their place of residence</li>
          <li>refugees who have not yet returned completely to their country</li>
          <li>another status to which the UN extends its protection</li>
